# CodeAlpha_BasicNetworkSniffer
I'm thrilled to report on my success throughout my internship in cybersecurity at CodeAlpha. ðŸš€ I just finished the first mission, which was to construct a Python Basic Network Sniffer.
Through this research, I was able to learn more about the specifics of network traffic and gain an understanding of how data flows and network packets are put together.
